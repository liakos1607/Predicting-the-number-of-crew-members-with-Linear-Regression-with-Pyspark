# Predicting-the-number-of-crew-members-with-Linear-Regression-with-Pyspark
In this project after retrieving data from UI Machine Learning Repository with the help of Spark i developed a simple Linear Regression Model using as evaluation Metrics RMSE and R2.The performance of the model was very good achiving over 0.9 R2 and a low RMSE result.More specifically the data are attached in the file cruise_ship_info.csv where with the libaries of pyspark all the features were fitted and trasformed accordingly(using VectorAssembler  and then functions fit and transform).Then after the evaluation completed with the help of corr function the crew members were indeed higly correlated with some key features of the dataset like passengers and cabines.
